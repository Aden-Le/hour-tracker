2. **Categorize Events & Members**
   - Assign event types (*e.g., "Volunteer Work", "Training"*) for easy categorization.
   - Group members into relevant categories for targeted tracking (*e.g., "Core Team", "Volunteers"*).

3. **Search & Generate Reports**

     - Total hours by event type.
     - Individual member contributions.
     - Comprehensive summaries of categorized activities.
